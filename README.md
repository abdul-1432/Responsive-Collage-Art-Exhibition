Responsive Collage Art Exhibition
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Responsive Collage Art Exhibition. This interactive web application features scroll animation, lightbox, and more, all made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were inspired by CodePen and have put together a user-friendly experience for all to enjoy.
